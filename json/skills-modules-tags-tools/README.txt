This is the file where you would upload the json files for each skill.

- The json can be added as one master file, or else it can be added as individual json files for each skill. 

- Once the json is added to this folder, then you would go to the Evolo settings in the Wordpress admin panel and press Refresh.

- These json files are also posted to the relevant database tables immediately when plugin is activated.
